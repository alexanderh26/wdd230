                <h1>Target Audience</h1>
                <p>The website advertises and informs about services available to "anyone willing to abide by the terms and policies outlined by the company" The target audience is temples workers, patrons, and their families. Specifically, those that have to travel to reach their temple destination, as they are the ones that will require lodging that the client will provide. Demographics of this target audience would vary widely, between both young users (for proxy ordinances and weddings) to older users (temple workers, temple leadership) </p>
                <h2>Scenarios</h2>
                <p>Scenarios for visitors to land on this page might include things like wanting to plan a potential trip, potential wedding, book for an existing temple trip, research different nearby temples, and get in contact with LDS services and missionaries to help them book their trip.   </p>
